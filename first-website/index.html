        <p>Screensavers are now antiquated pieces of software that were originally designed to prevent CRT screen burn-in.        

        Modern screens don’t have this problem anymore, but screensavers remain<br>
        <br>
        (though increasingly less common) as a relic of early home computing. The screensaver was a moment for the computer to rest and to dream in its own way, without the control of the user.</p>

        <p>Things to do while resting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be awesome</li>
            <li>think</li>
            <li>think about how awesome i am</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Things not to do while resting:</p>
        <ol>
