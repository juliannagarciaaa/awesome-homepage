        <h1>Keeping My Memories Alive</h1>
        <p>My very recent newfound interest has been creating risograph animations using videos in my camera roll or old home videos. I get a lot of inspiration for my work from</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Memories</li>
        <li>Experiences</li>
        <li>and Nostalgia</li>
    </ul>
        <p>I like to feel like I’m keeping those memories alive by bringing them back to life in this new form.</p>
      
        <h2>What Is a Risograph?</h2>
        <p>A risograph is a stencil based printing machine that originated in Japan. It’s described as a digital screen printer that uses eco-friendly soy based ink that creates unique, vibrant colors. It’s also known for creating a slightly imperfect grainy texture from the misregistration, it’s part of the charm.</p>
